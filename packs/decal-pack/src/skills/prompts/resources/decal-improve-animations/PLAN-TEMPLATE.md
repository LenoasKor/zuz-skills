# Decal Motion Proposal Template

Return one proposal per selected finding in the conversation. The executor may have zero context, so the proposal must contain everything exactly. Do not create a plan file, plan number, README index, status database, branch, or worktree.

```markdown
# <Short imperative title>

- **Suggested record**: Work | Bug | Task
- **Severity**: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
- **Category**: <audit category>
- **Estimated scope**: <n files, rough size>

## Problem

What is wrong, where, and why it matters to how the product feels. Cite every
location as `path/to/file.tsx:123` and include the current code verbatim:

​```css
/* src/components/dropdown.css:14 — current */
.dropdown { transition: all 400ms ease-in; }
​```

## Target

The exact end state. Every value spelled out — curves, durations, spring
configs, media queries. Never "use a nicer easing":

​```css
/* target */
.dropdown {
  transition: transform 200ms var(--ease-out), opacity 200ms var(--ease-out);
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin);
}
​```

## Repo conventions to follow

How this codebase already does it, with one exemplar the executor should
imitate (token names, file placement, prop patterns):

- Easing tokens live in `src/styles/tokens.css`; add new curves there, e.g. `--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);`
- <exemplar file:line that already does this correctly>

## Proposed steps

1. <One concrete edit per step: file, what changes, resulting code.>
2. …

## Boundaries

- Do NOT touch <files/components out of scope>.
- Do NOT change markup/structure — motion properties only (unless a step says otherwise).
- Do NOT add new dependencies.
- If a step doesn't match the code you find, STOP and re-audit instead of improvising.

## Verification

- **Mechanical**: <exact commands — typecheck, lint, build — with expected outcome>.
- **Feel check**: run the UI, trigger <interaction>, and confirm:
  - <observable check, e.g. "the dropdown scales from its trigger, not from center">
  - <e.g. "spamming the toggle never restarts the animation from zero">
  - In DevTools, set playback to 10% (Animations panel) and confirm <detail>.
  - Toggle `prefers-reduced-motion` (Rendering panel) and confirm movement is dropped but opacity feedback remains.
- **Done when**: <machine- or eye-checkable completion criteria>.
```

## Notes for the proposal author

- One proposal per finding. If two findings share every file and the same fix pattern, they may merge into one proposal.
- Pull every value from [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) — never approximate from memory.
- The feel check is not optional. Motion can be mechanically correct and still feel wrong; give the executor (or the human reviewing the executor's diff) concrete things to watch for in slow motion.
- Suggest **Bug** when observed behavior violates an existing motion or accessibility contract, **Work** for a small existing-interaction improvement, and **Task** for a new interaction or broad redesign.
- A suggestion is not registration authority. Register or implement only after the user requests or approves the exact scope under the project's Task/Work/Bug rules.
